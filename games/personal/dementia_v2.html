          Meant as a new iteration of <a href="./dementia_v1.html"><i>Dementia I</i></a>, <i>Dementia II</i> is a turn based strategy roguelike.
          Its initiative and action points systems makes it way more strategic than its very simple predecessor.
          No need to bump into enemies to hit them anymore thanks to the ability system, which allows easy access to diverse skills acquired through weaponry and experience.
          The change of programming language and library allows for a huge graphical improvement. From colored letters, items, characters and tiles are now actual hand drawn sprites.
          The progression system has also changed a lot : you now have seven skill trees to develop, and a system of "runes" to apply to weapons thanks to slots.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Because of how bloated <i>Dementia I</i> was, the friend with whom I worked and I decided to start the project again from scratch,
          using a more efficient programming language, C#, and an actual graphic library, MonoGame.
          We also redesigned the game a lot, as described above. However, the scope for the project was once again way too big.
          I have worked a bit on it since it was paused, but my friend more or less quit.
          That being said, and even though the game development has been on hold for years now, I still think about it sometimes,
          and I keep the design docs in case I were to work on it once more.
